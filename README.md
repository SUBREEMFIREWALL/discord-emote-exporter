# discord-emote-exporter
dumb experiments with javascript console

## why?
- to learn 
- because I don't want to depend on third party clients I don't understand

## usage
- ctrl-shift-i, sources, snippets. Make a snippet and run
- make sure the emote picker is open, selecing emotes from the server of choice
- invoke `extractEmotes()` from the console
- scroll up and then down through the server's emotes
- receive a quasi-json mess of the server's emotes, in order, with name and URL

## potential future features
- autoscroll?
- export as zip
- export stickers
